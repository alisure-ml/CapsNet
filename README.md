* [MATRIX CAPSULES WITH EM ROUTING](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=HJWLfGWRb)


## Result

#### 1. Reconstruction) 
> Just run runner.recons_random() as show in Run  

![Reconstruction](./readme/result_no_y.bmp)

#### 2. Paper 5.1: What the individual dimensions of a capsule represent
> Just run runner.recons_random_slow() as show in Run  

**Each row shows there construction when one of the 16 dimensions in the DigitCaps representation is tweaked by intervals of 1/63 in the range [âˆ’0.5,0.5], the leftmost col was not tweaked.**
